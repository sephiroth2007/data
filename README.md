Data Covid-19

Things to do:
Matias
Make corrections Graph 1:
- place a vertical line to the current last day
- adapt to cumulative chart like melbourne
- absolute date on x axis

Akshita
Make corrections Graph 2:
- place a vertical line to the last current day
- adapt graph 2 to area graph.
- place a horizontal line on graph 2 at y = 1
- absolute date on x axis

For area graph I was perhaps thinking of these alternatives:

overlapping areas

stacked area

If you find any better yet.

I would recommend first:
- Create area chart reading data using R75 and R25.
- Create area chart (R75 and R25) + line chart (R50).

I think the corrections less important are the vertical and horizontal lines. 

Final part (Both):
Joining Graph 1 and 2.
